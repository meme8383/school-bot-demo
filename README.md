# school-bot-demo

This is a discord bot to manage a school discord.
This is a modified version of a bot I created for my school's discord server which does not include any private information.

School name throughout the code replaced with "SCHOOL". ID's replaced with "InsertID".

This bot is designed to help people find others in a specific class, find out who a specific discord user is, and many other school-related tasks. This is not a bot with moderation commands or other basic functions. It is designed to work alongside other bots, as it has functions that no other bot would have and that would be useful to mainly this discord server.

# File Explanation:

bot.py - The bot python code.

classes.csv - A numbered list of classes at the school - not much functionality in current version.

users.csv - A list of users, with Discord ID, a list of classes, IRL names, grades, and guest status.

requirements.txt - A list of packages and versions. These may be very outdated.

token.txt - The bot token. Currently empty.

This project is no longer being updated. Many methods being used are inefficient and basic. This was my first real project, don't judge too hard.
