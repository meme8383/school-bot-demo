# school-bot-demo

This is a discord bot to manage a school discord.
This is a modified version of a bot I created for my school's discord server which does not include any private information.

File Explanation:
bot.py - The bot python code
classes.csv - A numbered list of classes at the school - not much functionality in current version
users.csv - A list of users, including various information

This project is no longer being updated. Many methods being used are inefficient and basic. This was my first real project, don't judge too hard.
