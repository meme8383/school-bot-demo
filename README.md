# school-bot-demo

This is a discord bot to manage a school discord.
This is a modified version of a bot I created for my school's discord server which does not include any private information.

This bot is designed to help people find others in a specific class, find out who a specific discord user is, and many other school-related tasks. This is not a bot with moderation commands or other basic functions. It is designed to work alongside other bots, as it has functions that no other bot would have and that would be useful to mainly this discord server.

# File Explanation:

bot.py - The bot python code

classes.csv - A numbered list of classes at the school - not much functionality in current version

users.csv - A list of users, including various information

This project is no longer being updated. Many methods being used are inefficient and basic. This was my first real project, don't judge too hard.
